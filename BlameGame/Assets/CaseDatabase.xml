  Team New Zealand boss Grant Dalton believes Oracle's constant presence on their Auckland trainings hints at a fast Kiwi boat for the looming America's Cup.
  Team New Zealand confirmed on Thursday they have concluded their training in Auckland and will dismantle their new AC50 to be air-freighted to Bermuda on April 9 along with the rest of their base infrastructure.
  They will resume training there in the final buildup to the opening Louis Vuitton Cup races on May 27 (NZ time)
